# There are 4 types of commands available : 

# 1) Binary                         ( /bin , /sbin ) check by typing $ type cat or type fdisk on command line and see the results
# 2) Aliases                        ( Aliases are shortcuts alias net="netstat -tulpn")
# 3) Shell Built-In Commands        ( cd , pwd, exit, export, alias )  
# 4) Functions                      ( Use functions when you have a common pattern and this pattern using functions can be effectively)
